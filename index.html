            <p>Web Developement is difficult,only then it is fun to do.You just have set your understands.if it were to be easy.would anyone do it?
            Stop Pushing people into web developement as if it is the only true career.Instead,Push people into computer science,programmming,coding,e.t.c.There is so much competion because everyone is doing it.You just create a lot of demoralized and disgruntled people.There is more to programming thanweb developement.
